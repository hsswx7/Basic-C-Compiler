Files that are compiled must have the extension .fs16 and then compiled file will have .asm (Example Test.fs16 file is included)
All .asm files are run on VirtMach

-Extension requirments can be chained in the main.c file

ex running comipler prgoram 
	make
	./comp filename 
	-> output filename.asm
ex Running VirtMach
	./VirtMach filename

P1 - > The Scanner is Table Driven I have included the file in the dir FSA_table.xlsx
P3/P4 are both LOCAL/GLOBAL


LOCAL OPTION IMPLEMENTED
files for part 3 are semantics.c semantics.h | stack.c stack.h

Excel file of the FSA_table is included 


FULL SCANNER IMPLEMENTATION

- I am creating a tree and if you would like the test the parser without the tree
  then please go to dir included ParseWithoutTree. 
- I am printing the Tree to the Screen professor didn't specifiy where to print the tree
